## A WordPress Plugin for MarkLogic Search

Very much work in progress.  Lots of things in flux.

For more info, hit me up [on twitter](http://twitter.com/eedeebee)

## Dependencies

* PHP 5.3+ in a web server (I've only tried Apache 2.2).
* WordPress 3.5+ or later (I've only tried 3.5)
* Composer

Only tried this on OS X so far, but I expect the plugin to work equally well on Linux and Windows.

Also, you should also install, if you don't have it, the [WordPress Session Manager Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-session-manager/)
plugin.  This plugin will work without that one, but you will get additional functionality with the Session Manager is available.
In particular, this plugin will generate hit-highlighted search result snippets.  When the Session Manager plugin is available, it will 
also hit highlight full posts based on the most recent search as well.


## Installation

1. Install the plugin in your WordPress plugin directory and use the WordPress admin UI to activate the plugin.
2. Install MarkLogic Server, create a database named `wordpress-01` and a REST API instance.  You can do this on your WordPress host or another host.  
Here is a [video of the installation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=n4Oem-DsQaU)
(See also the text version [here](http://developer.marklogic.com/learn/rest/setup)).  Remember the `hostname` of the server
(you can use localhost if this is the same host as you WordPress server), the `port` for the REST API instance you create,
and the admin credentials (`user` and `password`) to access your server.
3. TBD:  Upload the marklogic-db.xml package to MarkLogic's configuration manager on port 8002.  This will configure database indexes for use
by the plugin.
4. Browse to the WordPress admin dashboard, select the MarkLogic Search plugin on the left hand side, and provide your MarkLogic Server
settings (`host`, `port`, `username`, `password`).  The use the "Test connection" button to verify your settings work and save them.
Also, click the checkbox to Enable the plugin and then hit 'Reload all' to cause copies of your WordPress content to be loaded into MarkLogic Server.
5.  Boom, you are ready to go.

## Issues

Please file issues at https://github.com/marklogic/wordpress-marklogic-search/issues

## Development details

To get going, pull down the repository and then

    % composer update

to pick up the plugin's dependencies.  You'll also need to 
[create yourself a MarkLogic Server database and REST API instance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=n4Oem-DsQaU)
(See also the text version [here](http://developer.marklogic.com/learn/rest/setup)).

You can then install the plugin in WordPress and activate it.  This will get you an admin page
that you can use to set connection parameters based on your REST API instance.
For now, use your admin user credentials as I haven't worked out something more
fine grained yet.
